# Medical-Image-segmentation
Medical image segmentation has an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis systems in different applications. The vast investment and development of medical imaging modalities such as microscopy, dermoscopy, X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography attract researchers to implement new medical image-processing algorithms. Image segmentation is considered the most essential medical imaging process as it extracts the region of interest (ROI) through a semiautomatic or automatic process. It divides an image into areas based on a specified description, such as segmenting body organs/tissues in the medical applications for border detection, tumor detection/segmentation, and mass detection.
magine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders. The 2018 Data Science Bowl offers our most ambitious mission yet: create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection.
We’ve all seen people suffer from diseases like cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes. Many have seen their loved ones pass away. Think how many lives would be transformed if cures came faster.
