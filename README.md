# Medical-Image-segmentation

## What is Medical Image Segmentation?

Medical image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

## Why Medical Image Segmentation?

Medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in the analysis of medical images. It is the first step in extracting information from medical images. It is used to identify and localize structures of interest in medical images. It is also used to identify and classify different types of cells and tissues in medical images.
